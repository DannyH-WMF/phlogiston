<h1>VisualEditor Charts</h1>
<p>Most recent data: <!--# include file="ve_max_date.csv" --></p>
<p>These charts include data from the following projects:</p>
<pre><!--# include file="ve_projects.csv" --></pre>
<p>Tasks included in several of these projects are only counted in the first matching project.</p>
<h2>Burnups</h2>
<p>The complete backlog and burnup for all VE work.  The black line represents total completed tasks, and since it includes tasks from various tranches, does not exactly correlate to the tranches.</p>
<a href="ve-backlog_burnup.png"><img src="ve-backlog_burnup.png"/></a>
<p>Planned VE work.  This excludes, both in the backlog and the burnup line, Maintenance and General Backlog.  Maintenance is anything in Tranche 0; General Backlog is all work not categorized in the Tranches or blocker projects.  In general, any recently completed work in General Backlog is actually work completed months ago and recently identified as done, so it is appropriate to filter this out.  The black burnup is still not precisely correlated with the tranches, since it could include work from any tranche.  That is, if TR1 is 70% done and TR4 is 30% done (and they are the same size), then the burnup line would suggest that TR1 is 100% done and TR4 not started, which is false.  So this chart gives a general sense of progress through the tranches, but refer to the following single-tranche charts for precision.</p>

<h3>Tranches</h3>
<p>Tranche 0 is not expected to ever be completed, but a growth well above the burnup rate could signal a problem.  It includes: urgent interruptions, work that should be done before work in any other tranche is done; urgent non-essential work, that should be done soon but does not specifically block or pre-empt planned work; and work to categorize and manage work, because that may lead to interruptive work of the other two types.</p>
<a href="ve-tranch0_burnup.png"><img src="ve-tranch0_burnup.png"/></a>
<p>This is the current goal for VE work.  For completion within the forecast, the backlog should be stable with the burnup steadily increasing toward it.</p>

<p>Significant burnup on Tranches 2 or later may indicate that work should be re-prioritized, since Tranche 1 is considered more important to complete.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Trends in VE velocity week by week.</p>
<a href="ve-velocity.png"><img src="ve-velocity.png"/></a>
<p>The percentage of completed VE work per week that was spent on "maintenance" work.  The total fraction since June 18, 2015 is <!--# include file="ve_maintenance_fraction_total.csv" -->%.</p>
<a href="ve-maint_frac.png"><img src="ve-maint_frac.png"/></a>
<p>The size of the VE Backlog, that is, work that is planned or requested for VE and not completed.</p>
